Analysis from the [Baltimore/Washington National Weather Service](https://www.weather.gov/lwx/research_dcbalt_elnino) indicates that winter snowfall tends to be near to slightly below normal (based on 1981-2010) during all La Niña years (1950-2017) for Baltimore and Washington, D.C. Despite this, there is variability with these events. Further north in Buffalo and Rochester, NY, three of the five greatest one-day snowfalls occurred during La Niña years, indicated by the blue boxes in the table for Buffalo on the right. Similarly, three out of the five snowiest winters in Syracuse, NY, occurred during La Niña years.
