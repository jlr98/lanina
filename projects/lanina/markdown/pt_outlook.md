### Winter Temperature and Precipitation Outlooks

As of late October, outlooks for winter 2024–25 from NOAA’s [Climate Prediction Center](https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/) (right) favor above-normal temperatures for the entire Northeast. This is primarily linked to long-term climate trends. 

The precipitation outlook resembles La Niña precipitation anomaly patterns for the region, with wetter-than-normal conditions favored for the Ohio Valley, including parts of West Virginia and Pennsylvania. Long-term climate trends also played a role in this tilt toward above-normal precipitation. Equal chances were forecast in areas where climate signals are not as strong or historically reliable. These areas have a 33.3% chance each of above-, near-, or below-normal seasonal total precipitation. During La Niña winters, northern New England, portions of New York, and lake-effect areas can be snowier than usual, while the Mid-Atlantic tends to be less snowy. In addition, warmer-than-normal Great Lakes water temperatures enhance the likelihood of lake-effect precipitation.

The seasonal outlooks combine many factors including dynamical models and the effects of long-term trends, in addition to past La Niña patterns. Therefore, they may not match typical La Niña conditions exactly. Also, other factors can affect winter conditions, such as pre-existing global snow cover patterns or climate variability such as the Madden-Julian Oscillation, Arctic Oscillation, and North Atlantic Oscillation.
