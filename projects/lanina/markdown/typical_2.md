Although each La Ni√±a is different, there are some general patterns that are predictable. The jet stream flow tends to be very wave-like. An area of high pressure over the eastern North Pacific leads to increased blocking. The jet stream strength is variable, but usually enters North America in the northwestern U.S., with the active storm track along the northern states. This pattern brings increased storminess and above-normal precipitation to the Ohio Valley, as the jet stream steers storms that direction. There is also an increased frequency of cold air outbreaks in the central U.S. Conversely, the southern U.S. tends to experience below-normal precipitation and warmer-than-normal temperatures.
