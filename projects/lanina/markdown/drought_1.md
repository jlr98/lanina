#### Drought Relief

With drought conditions in place in the Northeast, this winter's La Niña could have implications for precipitation patterns across the region. During La Niña episodes, the Ohio Valley tends to be wetter, with the signal most pronounced during the three-month period of [February through April](https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/precip/CWlink/ENSO/composites/lanina.fma.precip.gif). If this pattern of increased precipitation were to emerge, it would be beneficial for easing drought conditions in areas such as West Virginia and southwestern Pennsylvania. Conversely, portions of eastern Maryland, Delaware, eastern Pennsylvania, and New Jersey experiencing drought could see dry conditions persist as southeastern parts of the region tend to be drier than normal during La Niña winters.
