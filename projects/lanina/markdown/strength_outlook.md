### La Niña Strength

During September, ENSO-neutral conditions were observed in the equatorial Pacific Ocean. While La Niña conditions have been [slow to emerge](https://www.climate.gov/news-features/blogs/enso/october-2024-enso-update-spooky-season) , NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center indicates there is a [60% chance](https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/analysis_monitoring/enso_advisory/ensodisc.shtml) that La Niña will develop in the September-November period, with it expected to continue through January-March. 

The stronger the La Niña, the more consistent the previously discussed precipitation and temperature patterns tend to be. For winter 2024-25, a weak strength La Niña is favored, increasing the odds that other atmospheric and oceanic factors will also influence the Northeast's weather patterns.
