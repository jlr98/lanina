#### Precipitation

The maps to the right illustrate the percent of normal precipitation for winter during all La Niña years since 1950.

The classic La Niña pattern of a wetter-than-normal Ohio Valley (including portions of western Pennsylvania and West Virginia) can be seen during most La Niña winters. Conversely, the southeastern corner of the Northeast trended drier than normal in over half of all La Niña winters. There have been 12 weak La Niña winters, with the region being drier than normal during six of them and wetter than normal during the other six. However, the Northeast averaged out to be wetter than normal during three of the four most recent weak La Niña winters (2008-09, 2017-18, and 2022-23).
